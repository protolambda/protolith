# Project guidelines:
#
# 1) Unit tests should be placed near the source file which is being tested
# 2) General tests should be placed in *repo-root*/test/
# 3) Every test file starts with "test_"
# 4) When configuration needs to be changed for a specific test/group of tests,
#    then a second nested test configuration should be used. (See `include` in test package docs:
#    https://github.com/dart-lang/test/blob/master/pkgs/test/doc/configuration.md#include)
