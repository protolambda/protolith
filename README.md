# Protolith

Protolith is a compositional codebase to innovate with in the blockchain space.

## Rationale

From the [Oxford Dictionary](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/protolith):

> The parent rock from which a given metamorphic rock developed.

We think of the code on ethereum-mainnet as one (well-defined) metamorphism of the concept of "blockchain".
When you want to build another metamorphism (e.g. a plasma chain), you should start at the base, but re-use components where possible.
Protolith provides an extensible abstraction of the many components used in popular blockchains,
 and enables you to literally [mix](https://www.dartlang.org/articles/language/mixins) them together.

Protolith aims to be:

1) Easy to re-compose for different user needs.
2) Easy to add new features to, without affecting existing code.
4) Easy to maintain; a well defined but extensible interface should enable innovations to be introduced easily.
3) Blockchain-agnostic. A compositional codebase enables different projects to build on it, and share their contributions.
5) Platform-agnostic. Dart may not be the fastest language, but scaling and innovation is about the bigger picture of architecture.
 Dart enables others to run it on servers (DartVM), browsers (dart2js), and mobile (Flutter).
